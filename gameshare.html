    <h2 class="hero-title">Here to revolutionize</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">Our journey started with a shared passion for sourcing, crafting, and showcasing the unparalleled beauty of raw Gemstones. Before the GemShare era, our team dedicated years to acquiring, cutting, polishing, and documenting these precious stones. From standalone gems to bespoke jewelry pieces, our creations found homes through private collectors, auctions, and developed partnerships.<br></br>
        The idea of GemShare blossomed when our valued partners and clients expressed a keen interest in owning fractional shares of these exceptional Gemstones. This sparked our shift to the blockchain, envisioning a platform where others could share in the beauty and investment potential of these unique treasures.<br></br>
        Our commitment revolves around transparency, ethical practices, and seamlessly integrating technology into the Gemstone investment experience. Every Gemstone on GemShare comes with its own unique history and a digital token on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity, traceability, and security.<br></br>
        As you explore GemShare, you're not just buying a fraction of a Gemstone, you're investing in a community where Gemstone enthusiasts, investors, and appreciators come together to celebrate the beauty and value of these timeless treasures.</p>

            <p class="maininfo-text">We purchase raw Gemstones straight from the mines, split them into tokens on the blockchain and allow anyone to purchase them.<br></br>
                In the meantime, said Gemstone gets cut, polished and developed into jewellery as well as certified and appraised.<br></br>
                Finally, once the Gemstone is sold, all of the token holders get their profits distributed automatically as written in the Smart Contract.</p>
